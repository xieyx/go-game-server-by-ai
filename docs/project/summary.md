# Go Game Server by AI - Project Summary

## Project Overview
This project implements a game server built with Go programming language, integrated with AI capabilities for enhanced gaming experiences. The server provides core functionality for managing players, rooms, and game sessions.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Project Structure
- Created standard Go project layout following best practices
- Organized code into cmd, internal, pkg, and docs directories
- Set up proper module structure with go.mod

### 2. Core Game Server Modules

#### Player Module
- Player management with ID, name, level, and score tracking
- Thread-safe operations using mutexes
- Timestamp tracking for creation and updates
- Comprehensive unit tests

#### Room Module
- Room management with player capacity limits
- Room status tracking (waiting, playing, closed)
- Thread-safe operations for adding/removing players
- Comprehensive unit tests

#### Game Module
- Overall game server management
- Room and player registration/unregistration
- Game session management (start/end games)
- Thread-safe operations for all functionality
- Comprehensive unit tests

### 3. Documentation
- Project overview and management documentation
- Development guidelines and best practices
- API documentation template
- PR description template
- Updated README with running and testing instructions

### 4. Testing
- Unit tests for all core modules
- Comprehensive test coverage for player, room, and game functionality
- Integration tests for game server operations

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Build verification on push and pull request events

### 6. Git Workflow
- Implemented GitFlow branching strategy
- Created main and develop branches
- Created feature branch for core game server implementation
- Merged feature branch into develop branch

## Technical Details

### Concurrency Handling
- Used sync.RWMutex for thread-safe operations
- Implemented proper locking mechanisms for read/write operations
- Ensured data consistency in concurrent environments

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase
- Meaningful error messages for debugging
- Proper error propagation

### Code Quality
- Followed Go code review comments and best practices
- Wrote clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Implemented proper package organization

## Testing Results
- All unit tests pass successfully
- Code coverage verified for all core modules
- Integration tests confirm proper functionality

## Next Steps
1. Implement RESTful API endpoints for game server functionality
2. Add WebSocket support for real-time communication
3. Integrate AI capabilities for enhanced gaming experiences
4. Implement database persistence for player and game data
5. Add authentication and authorization mechanisms
6. Implement logging and monitoring capabilities
7. Add more comprehensive integration and end-to-end tests

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.22 or higher
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:xieyx/go-game-server-by-ai.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd go-game-server-by-ai
   ```

### Running Tests
To run all tests:
```bash
go test ./...
```

To run tests with coverage:
```bash
go test -cover ./...
```

To run tests with verbose output:
```bash
go test -v ./...
```

### Running the Server
To run the game server:
```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

The server will start on port 8080 by default. You can change the port by setting the PORT environment variable:
```bash
PORT=3000 go run cmd/server/main.go
```
