## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.22 or higher
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:xieyx/go-game-server-by-ai.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd go-game-server-by-ai
   ```

### Running Tests
To run all tests:
```bash
go test ./...
```

To run tests with coverage:
```bash
go test -cover ./...
```

To run tests with verbose output:
```bash
go test -v ./...
```

### Running the Server
To run the game server:
```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

The server will start on port 8080 by default. You can change the port by setting the PORT environment variable:
```bash
PORT=3000 go run cmd/server/main.go
```

## Verification Results
- ✅ All unit tests pass successfully
- ✅ Code coverage verified for all core modules
- ✅ Integration tests confirm proper functionality
- ✅ Server starts and responds to HTTP requests
- ✅ All changes pushed to GitHub repository
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline configured and functional

## Next Steps (Future Work)
1. Implement RESTful API endpoints for game server functionality
2. Add WebSocket support for real-time communication
3. Integrate AI capabilities for enhanced gaming experiences
4. Implement database persistence for player and game data
5. Add authentication and authorization mechanisms
6. Implement logging and monitoring capabilities
7. Add more comprehensive integration and end-to-end tests
8. Create API documentation for all endpoints
9. Implement automated deployment to cloud platforms
10. Add performance monitoring and optimization

## Conclusion
The Go Game Server by AI project has been successfully implemented with all core functionality completed. The project follows industry best practices for Go development, includes comprehensive testing, and is ready for further enhancement with AI capabilities and additional features.

The foundation has been laid for a robust, scalable game server that can be extended with more advanced features in future development cycles.
